This bug demonstrates a common error in Solidity smart contracts: the lack of event emission when ownership is transferred.  The `transferOwnership` function updates the contract's ownership, but it fails to notify other parts of the application or external users.  This can lead to inconsistencies and vulnerabilities if other parts rely on knowing when the ownership changes. The solution adds an event emission to address this issue.
